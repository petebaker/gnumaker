Description: GNU Make is the defacto standard for efficiently
             rerunning appropriate steps in the data analysis or
             reporting process if a particular file is
             changed. Following changes, only the necessary steps are
             rerun. While GNU Make is usually thought of as a system for
	     creating executables from source, the gnumaker package makes
	     if easy to create and use GNU Makefiles to aid a reproducible
	     work flow for data analysis projects.
