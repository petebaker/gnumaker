# gnumaker

Version: 0.0.0.9009

## Overview

**gnumaker** makes if easy to create and use GNU Makefiles to aid a
reproducible work flow for data analysis projects.

GNU Make is the defacto standard for efficiently rerunning appropriate
steps in the data analysis or reporting process if a particular file is
changed. Only the necessary steps are rerun.

Rather than creating a new system for setting up and building output
from statistical software syntax files, **gnumaker** leverages off
existing GNU Make rules. These rules, for R, Sweave, R Markdown, Stata,
SAS and other syntax files are available at [r-makefile-definitions on
Github](https://github.com/petebaker/r-makefile-definitions). These are
described in P Baker (2020) Using GNU Make to Manage the Workflow of
Data Analysis Projects, *Journal of Statistical Software (Accepted)*.

For those not familiar with GNU Make, **gnumaker** allows simple
dependencies between files to be specified to produce a working Makefile
and the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG). Iâ€™d welcome Github
issues containing error reports or feature requests. Alternatively, you
can email the package maintainer at drpetebaker at gmail dot com.

## Installation

<!--
Install the latest CRAN version of **gnumaker** with:


```r
##install.packages("gnumaker")
```
## Note that three dependencies are in BioConductor so use BiocManager
NB: parked here in case biocViews: line in DESCRIPTION does not work

if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
   install.packages("BiocManager")
devtools::install_github("petebaker/gnumaker", repos = BiocManager::repositories())
-->

You can install the development version of **gnumaker** from GitHub
with:

``` r
## if you don't have devtools installed, automatically install it from CRAN
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
   install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("petebaker/gnumaker")
```

## Usage

There are currently four key functions in **gnumaker**. These are:

  - `create_makefile()` creates a `gnu_makefile` object given the
    specified dependencies between syntax, data and output files,
  - `write_makefile()` writes a `gnu_makefile` object to a `Makfile` on
    disk,
  - `info_rules()` provides information about data analysis `GNU Make`
    rules for various target and dependency filename extensions, and
  - `plot()` plots the DAG of a `gnu_makefile` object.

## Example

Suppose we have a data file `simple.csv` and use `read.R` to read and
clean the data. After storing the cleaned data in a .RData file, we then
employ `linmod.R` to plot and analyse the data. Next, using the stored
results, two reports `report1.pdf` and `report2.docx` are produced from
`report1.Rmd` and `report2.Rmd`. The workflow may be encapsulated in a
Makefile which is then employed to manage the process and generate or
regenerate any intermediate files when the data or syntax changes.

Rather than writing `GNU Make` commands, we can employ the **gnumaker**
package to create an appropriate `Makefile` called `Makefile.demo` with:

``` r
library(gnumaker)
gm1 <-
  create_makefile(targets = list(read = c("read.R", "simple.csv"),
                  linmod = c("linmod.R", "read"),
                  rep1 = c("report1.Rmd", "linmod"),
                  rep2 = c("report2.Rmd", "linmod")),
                  target.all = c("rep1", "rep2"),
                  all.exts = list(rep1 = "pdf", rep2 = "docx"))
write_makefile(gm1, file = "Makefile.demo")
#> File: Makefile.demo written at Sun Jul 19 15:40:31 2020
```

To plot the DAG, we use:

``` r
plot(gm1)
```

object can be produced with `plot(gm1)`. Using the minimal set of files

### Details

Using the **gnumaker** package we simply need to provide a list of
targets to the the `create_makefile` function where the components
specify a target as a name and dependency file(s) as a character vector.
The package uses the `GNU Make` pattern rules in `r-rules.mk` to choose
file names for targets but we can override the defaults.

For instance, in this example the first two dependency files are
`simple.csv` and `read.R` so we provide the first target as the first
component of the list as `read = c("read.R", "simple.csv")`, where the
name `read` can be anything we like. Note that the target filename for
`read` will be derived from the first failename in the list `read.R`.
The second target depends on the `read` target and `linmod.R` and so we
specify this with `linmod = c("linmod.R", "read")` and so on.

Using the function `create_makefile` to create a `gnu_makefile` object,
target file names are substituted using defaults and the appropriate
`Make` commands are rearranged using the DAG of the relationships. For
instance, the default target file for the first dependency in the `read`
component, which is `read.R`, becomes `read.Rout` but we can change the
default target file extension for all `.R` files using the
`default.exts` argument and specify say a HTML target file with
`default.exts = list(R = "html")`.

Finally we specify the first target (usually `all`) as two reports
`report1.pdf` and `report2.docx` using `target.all = c("rep1","rep2")`
which by default would be `report1.html` and `report2.html` but which we
specify as `report1.pdf` and `report2.docx` by specifying the option
`all.exts = list(rep1 = "pdf", rep2 = "docx")`.

Once we have constructed a suitable `gnu_makefile` object then we write
it to disk with `write_makefile`. To run all `R` script files and
analyses in order we simply type `make` in a terminal or set up
`RStudio` or our IDE to use GNU Make as the build mechanism which allows
us to (re)run analyses by pressing the appropriate Build button.

The `Makefile`, with optional comment for `linmod` target, is specified
using:

``` r
library(gnumaker)
gm1 <-
  create_makefile(targets = list(read = c("read.R", "simple.csv"),
                  linmod = c("linmod.R", "read"),
                  rep1 = c("report1.Rmd", "linmod"),
                  rep2 = c("report2.Rmd", "linmod")),
                  target.all = c("rep1", "rep2"),
                  all.exts = list(rep1 = "pdf", rep2 = "docx"),
 comments = list(linmod = "plots and analysis using 'linmod.R'"))
```

A Makefile `Makefile.demo` is produced with `write_makefile(gm1)`

``` r
write_makefile(gm1, file = "Makefile.demo")
#> File: Makefile.demo written at Sun Jul 19 15:40:31 2020
```

We can use the function `info_rules` to determine the possible target
files for dependency files. For instance, what target files have
`Makefile` rules for an `.R` R syntax file?

``` r
info_rules("R")
#> Possible filename extensions for 'R':
#> [1] "docx" "html" "odt"  "pdf"  "Rout" "rtf" 
#> 
#> Default: 'Rout'
#> 
#> Example rules:
#> example1.Rout: example1.R dep_file2 dep_file3
#>  or
#> example1.Rout: {@:.Rout=.R} dep_file2 dep_file3
#> 
#> NB: For further help on Makefile rules, type 'make help' in a terminal once
#>     an appropriate 'Makefile' is present in the current directory
```

For `.Rmd` R Markdown files, use

``` r
info_rules("Rmd")
#> Possible filename extensions for 'Rmd':
#>  [1] "_beamer-handout.Rmd" "_beamer.pdf"         "_ioslides.html"     
#>  [4] "_slidy.html"         "_tufte.pdf"          "-syntax.R"          
#>  [7] "docx"                "html"                "odt"                
#> [10] "pdf"                 "pptx"                "rtf"                
#> 
#> Default: 'html'
#> 
#> Example rules:
#> example1.html: example1.Rmd dep_file2 dep_file3
#>  or
#> example1.html: {@:.html=.Rmd} dep_file2 dep_file3
#> 
#> Other options are available for R Markdown files, such as:
#> 
#> example1_ioslides.html: example1.Rmd dep_file2 dep_file3
#> example1_beamer.pdf: example1.Rmd dep_file2 dep_file3
#> 
#> to produce ioslide and beamer presentation formats.
#> 
#> An R syntax file can be produced with
#>   make example1-syntax.R
#> and a similar rule can be specified if required with
#> example1-syntax.R: example1.Rmd dep_file2 dep_file3
#> 
#> NB: For further help on Makefile rules, type 'make help' in a terminal once
#>     an appropriate 'Makefile' is present in the current directory
```

## Note

**gnumaker** is under construction and could change (and improve)
rapidly at various times but this depends on work/life balance.
