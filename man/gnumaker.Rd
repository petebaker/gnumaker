\title{gnumaker: A package for GNU Makefile creation and plotting}
\description{
The gnumaker package has three important functions:
\code{create_makefile}, \code{write_makefile}, \code{plot}
}
\section{gnumaker functions}{


\code{GNU Make} is the defacto build system for many programs
including the \code{linux} operating system.  Standard GNU Make
pattern rules are available at
\url{https://github.com/petebaker/r-makefile-definitions} and also with
the \code{gnumaker} package.

\code{link{create_makefile}} is used to create the text of a
\code{Makefile} and also the associated directed acyclic graph
(DAG). This object can be written to a \code{Makefile} using
\code{\link{write_makefile}} and the DAG may be plotted using
\code{\link{plot}}
